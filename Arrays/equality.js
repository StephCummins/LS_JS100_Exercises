// Predict the output of the below code. When you run the code, do you see 
// what you expected? Why or why not?

let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);

// I predicted that this will log false, because even though array1 and array2
// have the same values, they are two different arrays that are stored 
// separately in memory. I was correct.
