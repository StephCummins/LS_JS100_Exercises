// Find out how we can join two or more strings together.

// The .concat() method allows one or more strings to be joined together:

const hello = "Hello, ";
console.log(hello.concat("all ", "you beautiful people.");
// “Hello all you beautiful people.” 

// You can also use the + operator to concatenate strings:

let firstWord = “Hello, ”;
let secondWord = “world!”;
console.log(firstWord + secondWord);
// “Hello, world!”
